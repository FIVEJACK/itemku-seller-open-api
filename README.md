### Public Bug Tracker for itemku Seller Open API

Please submit API bugs for the itemku team to look at here. We'd like to use the "thumbs up" reaction as an upvote to track priority from the community, so to "+1" an issue please add a thumbs up reaction to it.

Remember to be kind to everyone here.

This is an experiment for the team so please be understanding as we figure out what works and what doesn't with this.

Thank you!
